VoiceOver is a built-in screen reader that reads aloud the items that appear on the device screen. It is free and it vocalizes all visible elements in the page specially for blind or partially sighted, dyslexic or illiterate users. A tool like VoiceOver is called either screen reader or speech synthesizer, even if a screen reader is actually a software associated with voice synthesis.

When VoiceOver is on, the standard gestures behave differently. Furthermore, additional gestures let you move the focus on the screen and control the selected items. VoiceOver has gestures with one, two and three fingers to select and to go through elements. We describe here the basic gestures commonly used.

## Common gestures
