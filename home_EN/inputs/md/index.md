## What is digital accessibility?

Digital accessibility is about making the access to digital information possible regardless of the nature of a person’s disability and how they consult the information. It involves different technologies such as the Web, videos, Word and PDF documents, but also digital television or mobile phones. 

It is not a question of increasing the number of information outlets, but of respecting functional, graphical, technical and editorial rules that will enable everyone to access information no matter what tools they use.

## Who is concerned by digital accessibility?

Being disabled is not limited to what other people can see.
Also, it is not necessarily a permanent situation and it can happen to any of us at some point in our life.
