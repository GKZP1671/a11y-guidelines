## What is digital accessibility ?

<div class="axs-picto axs">
Digital accessibility is about making possible the access to digital information regardless of the nature of the disability of the persons and how each consults the information. It involves different technologies such as the Web, videos, Word and PDF documents, but also the digital television or mobile phones. 

It is not a question of increasing the information media, but to respect the functional, graphical, technical and editorial rules that will enable everyone to access information no matter what tools they use.

## Who is concerned by the digital accessibility ?

The situations of handicap identified are not only those that are visible.   
They are not necessarily final and can happen to us at some point in our life.
