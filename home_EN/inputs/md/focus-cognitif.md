**Cognitive disability** is the consequence of cognitive dysfunctions: attention or memory trouble, problems with coping with change, with language, with perceptive identification and gestures. Cognitive disability **does not imply intellectual deficiency**, but difficulties to muster capacities.

This should not be mistaken for mental or psychological handicap:

- Mental handicap, which results from an intellectual disability: a limited capacity to learn and an intellectual development significantly lower than average that translates as more or less important difficulties to think, conceptualise, communicate, decide, etc.
- Psychological handicap, which results from invalidating psychological trouble. Like cognitive handicap, psychological handicap does not imply intellectual deficiency. It is characterised by alternating mental states of calm and tension, and by difficulties to acquire or express psychosocial abilities, with attention deficits and difficulties to elaborate and follow a plan of action. It can be translated in anguish, cognitive crises (problems with memorisation, attention, organisation, anticipation, adaptation to a context) and in difficulties to relate to people and in communication.

### Dys* troubles

Dys* troubles are lasting neurological troubles that affect a particular cognitive function like reading, gestures, computing… it is not an intellectual deficiency, but a different mode of reasoning.

Dys* troubles encompass several conditions:

- Dyslexia: reading disorder
- Dysorthographia: writing disorder
- Dysphasia: language disorder
- Dyscalculia: trouble with arithmetic and logic and mathematical reasoning
- Dyspraxia: coordination disorder

Dyslexia impacts digital accessibility.
