## Introduction and background

For Orange internal accessibility requirements, we have chosen to rely on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) (WCAG 2). Those guidelines are international guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) task force, which comply with the ISO standard 40500:2012.

All HTML pages made by the Orange group must **comply with the AA level criteria of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, without blocking point** for the user after testing the main features of the site or application.

For the technical solutions, we refer to an external content available at [Accede-Web references](http://wiki.accede-web.com/en/home). Indeed, these references are very useful, pedagogical and come from Atalan, a group of major companies as well as schools and associations of people with disabilities.

These references are translated into English and are very famous in e-Accessibility as source of good practice, complete and high-quality. These references are updated regularly to stick to the evolution of technologies (browsers, assistive technology...).

## Examples

Didactic examples for user interface components or elements particularly difficult to make accessible and frequently used are available in the [examples](./exemples.html).
These examples use the [Boosted](http://boosted.orange.com/) library. This library is based on [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to quickly make a responsive/accessible website  branded with the Orange colors.

## Reminder : accede-web references

Orange web accessibility guidelines refer to accessibility references available on the [accede-web](http://wiki.accede-web.com/en/) site.
